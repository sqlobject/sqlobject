0. Run full test suite in master. Continue if all tests passed.

1. If the branching point is master run ../branch $NEW_BRANCH. If it's
not master run ../branch $NEW_BRANCH $TREEISH, where $TREEISH is
a branch, a commit id or a tag.

1a. The script creates a new branch and calls editor; edit README.rst,
    __version__.py and News.rst in the branch - set version. In
    setup.cfg in the branch edit section [publish] - uncomment doc-dest
    for stable branch. In setup.py in the branch edit URL (remove
    '/devel') and download URL. In setup.py and DeveloperGuide.rst edit
    Travis CI build status image URL (change branch). Commit.

1b. If the branching point was master the script checks out master and
    calls editor again; edit README.rst, __version__.py and News.rst in
    master - set version for the next release. Edit branch in
    appveyor.yml. In setup.py edit "Development Status" in trove
    classifiers. Commit.

1c. If the branching point was master the script updates versions in
    SQLObject-master.rst. If the branching point was not master the
    script updates versions in SQLObject-$branch.rst.

2. To deprecate a version of Python edit files docs/News.rst,
   docs/SQLObject.rst, docs/TODO.rst, sqlobject/main.py, README.rst and
   setup.py in master.

3. Do a null-merge from the new branch to the higher branch or the
   master.

4. Run ../push-all to push all branches and tags to the public
   repositories.
