SQLObject 0.12
==============

Thanks for looking at SQLObject.  SQLObject is an object-relational
mapper, i.e., a library that will wrap your database tables in Python
classes, and your rows in Python instances.

It currently supports MySQL through the `MySQLdb` package, PostgreSQL
through the `psycopg` package, SQLite, Firebird, MaxDB (SAP DB), MS SQL
and Sybase.  It should support Python versions back to 2.3.

For more information please see the documentation in
docs/SQLObject.txt, or online at http://sqlobject.org/
