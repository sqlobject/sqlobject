SQLObject (trunk)
=================

Features & Interface
--------------------

* Dropped support for Python 2.3. The minimal version of Python for
  SQLObject is 2.4 now.

* Dropped support for PostgreSQL 7.2. The minimal supported version of
  PostgreSQL is 7.3 now.

* New magic attribute 'j' similar to 'q' was added that automagically does
  join with the other table in MultipleJoin or RelatedJoin.

* SQLObject can now create and drop a database in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
  and Firebird/Interbase.

* Added some support for schemas in PostgreSQL.

* RowDestroyedSignal and RowUpdatedSignal were added.

Minor features
--------------

* Use reversed() in manager/command.py instead of .__reversed__().

* Added DecimalStringCol - similar to DecimalCol but stores data as strings
  to work around problems in some drivers and type affinity problem in
  SQLite.

* Added sqlobject.include.hashcol.HashCol - a column type that automatically
  hashes anything going into it, and returns out an object that hashes
  anything being compared to itself. Basically, it's good for really simple
  one-way password fields, and it even supports the assignment of None to
  indicate no password set. By default, it uses the md5 library for
  hashing, but this can be changed in a HashCol definition.

* Changed the order of testing of SQLite modules - look for external
  PySQLite2 before sqlite3.

SQLObject 0.10.6
================

Released 18 May 2009

* Better support for Python 2.6: do not import the deprecated sets module.

* A number of changes ported from `SQLObject 0.9.11`_.

SQLObject 0.10.5
================

Released 6 May 2009

* A number of changes ported from `SQLObject 0.9.10`_.

* sqlmeta.getColumns() becomes classmethod.

SQLObject 0.10.4
================

Released 8 Dec 2008.

* Fixed createSQL constrains generation under MySQL when the table's name
  includes the database's name (contains a dot).

SQLObject 0.10.3
================

Released 1 Dec 2008.

* A number of changes ported from `SQLObject 0.9.8`_.

SQLObject 0.10.2
================

Released 30 May 2008.

* A number of changes ported from `SQLObject 0.9.7`_.

SQLObject 0.10.1
================

Released 4 May 2008.

* Fixed a bug: limit doesn't work in sqlbuilder.Select.

* A number of changes ported from `SQLObject 0.9.6`_.

SQLObject 0.10.0
================

Released 11 Mar 2008.

Features & Interface
--------------------

* Dropped support for Python 2.2. The minimal version of Python for
  SQLObject is 2.3 now.

* Removed actively deprecated attributes;
  lowered deprecation level for other attributes to be removed after 0.10.

* SQLBuilder Select supports the rest of SelectResults options (reversed,
  distinct, joins, etc.)

* SQLObject.select() (i.e., SelectResults) and DBConnection.queryForSelect()
  use SQLBuilder Select queries; this make all SELECTs implemented
  internally via a single mechanism.

* SQLBuilder Joins handle SQLExpression tables (not just str/SQLObject/Alias)
  and properly sqlrepr.

* Added SQLBuilder ImportProxy. It allows one to ignore the circular import
  issues with referring to SQLObject classes in other files - it uses the
  classregistry as the string class names for FK/Joins do, but specifically
  intended for SQLBuilder expressions. See
  tests/test_sqlbuilder_importproxy.py.

* Added SelectResults.throughTo. It allows one to traverse relationships
  (FK/Join) via SQL, avoiding the intermediate objects. Additionally, it's
  a simple mechanism for pre-caching/eager-loading of later FK
  relationships (i.e., going to loop over a select of somePeople and ask
  for aPerson.group, first call list(somePeople.throughTo.group) to preload
  those related groups and use 2 db queries instead of N+1). See
  tests/test_select_through.py.

* Added ViewSQLObject.

* Added sqlmeta.getColumns() to get all the columns for a class (including
  parent classes), excluding the column 'childName' and including the column
  'id'. sqlmeta.asDict() now uses getColumns(), so there is no need to
  override it in the inheritable sqlmeta class; this makes asDict() to work
  properly on inheritable sqlobjects.

* Allow MyTable.select(MyTable.q.foreignKey == object) where object is
  an instance of SQLObject.

* Added rich comparison methods; SQLObjects of the same class are
  considered equal is they have the same id; other methods return
  NotImplemented.

* RowDestroySignal is sent on destroying an SQLObject instance; postfunctions
  are run after the row has been destroyed.

* Changed the implementation type in BoolCol under SQLite from TINYINT to
  BOOLEAN and made fromDatabase machinery to recognize it.

* MySQLConnection (and DB URI) accept a number of SSL-related parameters:
  ssl_key, ssl_cert, ssl_ca, ssl_capath.

* Use sets instead of dicts in tablesUsed. Dropped tablesUsedDict function;
  instead there is tablesUsedSet that returns a set of strings.

* SQLBuilder tablesUsedSet handles sqlrepr'able objects.

* Under MySQL, PickleCol no longer used TEXT column types; the smallest
  column is now BLOB - it is not possible to create TINYBLOB column.

SQLObject 0.9.11
================

Released 18 May 2009

* Two bug in SQLiteConnection.columnsFromSchema() were fixed: use
  sqlmeta.idName instead of 'id'; convert default 'NULL' to None.

* Use sqlmeta.idName instead of 'id' in all connection classes.

* Fixed a bug that prevented to override per class _connection if there is
  sqlhub.processConnection.

SQLObject 0.9.10
================

Released 6 May 2009

* Another unicode-related patch for MySQL; required because different
  versions of MySQLdb require different handling::

   - MySQLdb < 1.2.1: only ascii
   - MySQLdb = 1.2.1: only unicode
   - MySQLdb > 1.2.1: both ascii and unicode

* Setup requires FormEncode version 1.1.1+.

* A minor bug was fixed in creating a DecimalValidator - pass the column name
  to it.

* A bug was fixed in InheritableIteration - pass connection to child
  klass.select().

* A bug was fixed in PostgresConnection.columnsFromSchema() - foreign keys
  are now recognized and created as proper ForeignKey with correct
  column name and table name.

* Bugs in PostgresConnection and MSSQLConnection related to properties was
  fixed. A note for developers: from now on properties in DBConnection
  classes are forbidden as they don't work with Transaction -
  Transaction.__getattr__() cannot properly wrap 'self' so a property is
  called with wrong 'self'.

* Transaction instances now explicitly raises TypeError on close() -
  without this calling Transaction.close() calls connection.close() which
  is wrong.

* A bug in SQLiteConnection.columnsFromSchema() that led to an infinite
  loop was fixed.

SQLObject 0.9.9
===============

* Backported from the trunk: under MySQL use the connection's dbEncoding
  instead of ascii, when converting a unicode value from python to database
  for a StringCol.

SQLObject 0.9.8
===============

Released 1 Dec 2008.

* Changed interpretation of strings in the DB URI for boolean parameters:
  '0', 'no', 'off' and 'false' are now interpreted as False.

* Fixed a bug with incorrect handling of calls like
  connectionForURI(dburi, cache=False) when dburi already contains some
  parameters in the URI.

* Convert decimal.to_eng_string() to str to work around a bug in Python 2.5.2;
  see http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-March/078189.html

* Added test_default_style.py.

* Fixed a minor bug in SQLiteConnection that fails to parse Enum columns.

SQLObject 0.9.7
===============

Released 30 May 2008.

Small Features
--------------

* Use VARCHAR(MAX) and VARBINARY(MAX) for MSSQL >= 9.0.

* Run post_funcs after RowDestroySignal.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a minor bug in Set column.

* A bug fixed for RowCreatedSignal together with InheritableSQLObject:
  run post_funcs after the entire hierarchy has been created.

* Aggregate functions now honors 'distinct'.

SQLObject 0.9.6
===============

Released 4 May 2008.

* A bug in inheritable delColumn() that doesn't remove properties was fixed.

* A minor bug was fixed in col.py - the registry must be passed to findClass().

* Reverted the patch declarative.threadSafeMethod() - it causes more harm
  then good.

SQLObject 0.9.5
===============

Released 10 Mar 2008.

* Fixed a minor bug in SQLiteConnection.columnsFromSchema() - set dbName.

* A bug in delColumn() that removes all properties was fixed by recreating
  properties.

SQLObject 0.9.4
===============

Released 3 Mar 2008.

* Use list.reverse() in manager/command.py for Python 2.2 compatibility.

* Prevent MultipleJoin from removing the intermediate table if it was not
  created by the Join.

* Fixed a bug with no default when defaultSQL is defined for the column.

* Recognize POINT data type as string in PostgresConnection.columnsFromSchema().

SQLObject 0.9.3
===============

Released 10 Jan 2008.

* A number of changes ported from `SQLObject 0.7.10`_.

SQLObject 0.9.2
===============

Released 30 Oct 2007.

* Fixed a bug in Versioning - do not copy "alternateID" and "unique"
  attributes from the versioned table.

* Fixed a misspelled 'zerofill' option's name.

* Fixed bugs in SQLiteConnection.guessColumn().

* A number of changes ported from `SQLObject 0.7.9`_ and `SQLObject 0.8.6`_.

SQLObject 0.9.1
===============

Released 25 July 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed misspelled methods in col.py.

* A number of bugfixes ported from `SQLObject 0.7.8`_ and `SQLObject 0.8.5`_.

SQLObject 0.9.0
===============

Released 10 May 2007.

Features & Interface
--------------------

* Support for Python 2.2 has been declared obsolete.

* Removed actively deprecated attributes;
  lowered deprecation level for other attributes to be removed after 0.9.

* SQLite connection got columnsFromSchema(). Now all connections fully support
  fromDatabase. There are two version of columnsFromSchema() for SQLite -
  one parses the result of "SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master" and the other
  uses "PRAGMA table_info"; the user can choose one over the other by using
  "use_table_info" parameter in DB URI; default is False as the pragma is
  available only in the later versions of SQLite.

* Changed connection.delColumn(): the first argument is sqlmeta, not
  tableName (required for SQLite).

* SQLite connection got delColumn(). Now all connections fully support
  delColumn(). As SQLite backend doesn't implement "ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN"
  delColumn() is implemented by creating a new table without the column,
  copying all data, dropping the original table and renaming the new table.

* Versioning_.

.. _Versioning: Versioning.html

* MySQLConnection got new keyword "conv" - a list of custom converters.

* Use logging if it's available and is configured via DB URI.

* New columns: TimestampCol to support MySQL TIMESTAMP type;
  SetCol to support MySQL SET type;
  TinyIntCol for TINYINT; SmallIntCol for SMALLINT;
  MediumIntCol for MEDIUMINT; BigIntCol for BIGINT.

Small Features
--------------

* Support for MySQL INT type attributes: UNSIGNED, ZEROFILL.

* Support for DEFAULT SQL attribute via defaultSQL keyword argument.

* cls.tableExists() as a shortcut for conn.tableExists(cls.sqlmeta.table).

* cls.deleteMany(), cls.deleteBy().

Bug Fixes
---------

* idName can be inherited from the parent sqlmeta class.

SQLObject 0.8.7
===============

Released 10 Jan 2008.

* A number of changes ported from `SQLObject 0.7.10`_.

SQLObject 0.8.6
===============

Released 30 Oct 2007.

* Removed SelectResults.__nonzero__, which was a design mistake. Raising an
  exception in __nonzero__() is inconsistent with other iterators
  (bool(iter([])) => True).

* A number of changes ported from `SQLObject 0.7.9`_.

SQLObject 0.8.5
===============

Released 25 July 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Suppress the second RowUpdateSignal in .set() called from ._SO_setValue().

SQLObject 0.8.4
===============

Released 10 May 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* A number of bugfixes forward-ported from 0.7.7.

SQLObject 0.8.3
===============

Released 3 May 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* A number of bugfixes forward-ported from 0.7.6.

SQLObject 0.8.2
===============

Released 11 Apr 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed ConnectionHub.doInTransaction() - if the original connection was
  processConnection - reset processConnection, not threadConnection.

SQLObject 0.8.1
===============

Released 19 Mar 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* ID columns are reverted back from INT UNSIGNED to INT for MySQL to be in
  accord with FOREIGN KEYs.

* Fixed return value from Firebird/MaxdbConnection.createTable().

* Fixed and simplified DatabaseIndex.get().

* Fixed ConnectionHub.doInTransaction() - close low-level connection on
  commit() to prevent connections leaking.

SQLObject 0.8.0
===============

Released 12 Feb 2007.

Features & Interface
--------------------

* It is now possible to create tables that reference each other.
  Constraints (in the DBMSes that support constraints) are added after the
  tables have been created.

* Added ``createSQL`` as an option for sqlmeta. Here you can add
  related SQL you want executed by sqlobject-admin create after table
  creation. createSQL expects a string, list, or dictionary. If using
  a dictionary the key should be a dbName value (ex. 'postgres') and
  the value should be a string or list.  Examples in
  sqlobject/tests/test_sqlobject_admin.py or at
  <http://sqlobject.org/sqlobject-admin.html#the-create-command>

* Added method ``sqlhub.doInTransaction(callable, *args, **kwargs)``,
  to be used like::

      sqlhub.doInTransaction(process_request, os.environ)

  This will run ``process_request(os.environ)``.  The return
  value will be preserved.

* Added method ``.getOne([default])`` to ``SelectResults`` (these are
  the objects returned by ``.select()`` and ``.selectBy()``).  This
  returns a single object, when the query is expected to return only
  one object.  The single argument is the value to return when zero
  results are found (more than one result is always an error).  If no
  default is given, it is an error if no such object exists.

* Added a WSGI middleware (in ``sqlobject.wsgi_middleware``) for
  configuring the database for the request.  Also handles
  transactions.  Available as ``egg:SQLObject`` in Paste Deploy
  configuration files.

* New joins! ManyToMany and OneToMany; not fully documented yet, but still
  more sensible and smarter.

* SELECT FOR UPDATE

* New module dberrors.py - a hierarchy of exceptions. Translation of DB API
  module's exceptions to the new hierarchy is performed for SQLite and MySQL.

* SQLiteConnection got a new keyword "factory" - a name or a reference to
  a factory function that returns a connection class; useful for
  implementing functions or aggregates. See test_select.py and
  test_sqlite_factory.py for examples.

* SQLObject now disallows columns with names that collide with existing
  variables and methods, such as "_init", "expire", "set" and so on.

Small Features
--------------

* Configurable client character set (encoding) for MySQL.

* Added a close option to .commit(), so you can close the transaction as
  you commit it.

* DecimalValidator.

* Added .expireAll() methods to sqlmeta and connection objects, to expire
  all instances in those cases.

* String IDs.

* FOREIGN KEY for MySQL.

* Support for sqlite3 (a builtin module in Python 2.5).

* SelectResults cannot be queried for truth value; in any case it was
  meaningless - the result was always True; now __nonzero__() raises
  NotImplementedError in case one tries bool(MyTable.select()) or
  "if MyTable.select():..."

* With empty parameters AND() and OR() returns None.

* Allows to use set/frozenset sets/Set/ImmutableSet sets as sequences
  passed to the IN operator.

* ID columns are now INT UNSIGNED for MySQL.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed problem with sqlite and threads; connections are no longer shared
  between threads for sqlite (except for :memory:).

* The reference loop between SQLObject and SQLObjectState eliminated using
  weak references.

* Another round of bugfixes for MySQL errors 2006 and 2013 (SERVER_GONE,
  SERVER_LOST).

* Fixed a bug in MSSQLConnection caused by column names being unicode.

* Fixed a bug in FirebirdConnection caused by column names having trailing
  spaces.

* Order by several columns with inheritance.

* Fixed aggregators and accumulators with inheritance.

SQLObject 0.7.10
================

Released 10 Jan 2008.

* With PySQLite2 do not use encode()/decode() from PySQLite1 - always use
  base64 for BLOBs.

* MySQLConnection doesn't convert query strings to unicode (but allows to
  pass unicode query strings if the user build ones). DB URI parameter
  sqlobject_encoding is no longer used.

SQLObject 0.7.9
===============

Released 30 Oct 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Remove 'limit' from SelectResults after setting start/end so .clone()
  never sees limit again.

* Fixed a bug in sqlbuilder._LikeQuoted() - call sqlrepr() on the
  expression to escape single quotes if the expression is a string.

* Fixed StringCol and UnicodeCol: use sqlType with MSSQL.

* Fixed startswith/endswith/contains for UnicodeCol.

Other Changes
-------------

* Changed the default value for 'varchar' in BLOBColumns from 'auto' to False
  (so that the default type for the columns in MySQL is BLOB, not TEXT).

* Changed the implementation type in BoolCol under MySQL from TINYINT to
  BOOL (which is a synonym for TINYINT(1)).

SQLObject 0.7.8
===============

Released 25 July 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Replaced calls to style.dbColumnToPythonAttr() in joins.py by name/dbName
  lookup in case the user named columns differently using dbName.

* Minor correction in the tests: we fully support EnumCol in Postgres.

* MySQLConnection now recognizes Enum, Double and Time columns when drawing the
  database scheme from DB.

* Minor fix in FirebirdConnection.fromDatabase.

* Fixed a bug with default field values for columns for Firebird connection.

* Fixed a bug in col.createSQL().

* Fixed a bug in converting date/time for years < 1000 (time.strptime()
  requires exactly 4 digits for %Y, hence a year < 1000 must be 0-padded).

Other Changes
-------------

* Changed string quoting style for PostgreSQL and MySQL from \\' to ''.

SQLObject 0.7.7
===============

Released 10 May 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a bug in SQLRelatedJoin that ignored per-instance connection.

* Fixed a bug in MySQL connection in case there is no charset in the DB URI.

SQLObject 0.7.6
===============

Released 3 May 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a longstanding bug with .select() ignoring 'limit' parameter.

* Fixed a bug with absent comma in JOINs.

* Fixed sqlbuilder - .startswith(), .endswith() and .contains() assumed
  their parameter must be a string; now you can pass an SQLExpression:
  Table.q.name.contains(func.upper('a')), for example.

* Fixed a longstanding bug in sqlbuilder.Select() with groupBy being a
  sequence.

* Fixed a bug with Aliases in JOINs.

* Yet another patch to properly initialize MySQL connection encoding.

* Fixed a minor comparison problem in test_decimal.py.

* More documentation about orderBy.

SQLObject 0.7.5
===============

Released 11 Apr 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed test_deep_inheritance.py - setup classes in the correct order
  (required for Postgres 8.0+ which is strict about referential integrity).

* Fixed a bug in DateValidator caused by datetime being a subclass of date.

SQLObject 0.7.4
===============

Released 19 Mar 2007.

Small Features
--------------

* For MySQLdb 1.2.2+ call ping(True) on the connection to allow
  autoreconnect after a timeout.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Another round of changes to create/drop the tables in the right order
  in the command-line client `sqlobject-admin`.

* Fixed a bug in UnicodeField - allow comparison with None.

SQLObject 0.7.3
===============

Released 30 Jan 2007.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Allow multiple MSSQL connections.

* Psycopg1 requires port to be a string; psycopg2 requires port to be an int.

* Fixed a bug in MSSQLConnection caused by column names being unicode.

* Fixed a bug in FirebirdConnection caused by column names having trailing
  spaces.

* Fixed a missed import in firebirdconnection.py.

* Remove a leading slash in FirebirdConnection.

* Fixed a bug in deep Inheritance tree.

SQLObject 0.7.2
===============

Released 20 Nov 2006.

Features & Interface
--------------------

* sqlbuilder.Select now supports JOINs exactly like SQLObject.select.

* destroySelf() removes the object from related joins.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a number of unicode-related problems with newer MySQLdb.

* If the DB API driver returns timedelta instead of time (MySQLdb does
  this) it is converted to time; but if the timedelta has days an exception
  is raised.

* Fixed a number of bugs in InheritableSQLObject related to foreign keys.

* Fixed a bug in InheritableSQLObject related to the order of tableRegistry
  dictionary.

* A bug fix that allows to use SQLObject with DateTime from Zope.

Documentation Added
-------------------

* Added "How can I define my own intermediate table in my Many-to-Many
  relationship?" to FAQ.

SQLObject 0.7.1
===============

Released 25 Sep 2006.

Features & Interface
--------------------

* Added support for psycopg2_

.. _psycopg2: http://initd.org/projects/psycopg2

* Added support for MSSQL.

* Added ``TimeCol``.

* ``RelatedJoin`` and ``SQLRelatedJoin`` objects have a
  ``createRelatedTable`` keyword argument (default ``True``).  If
  ``False``, then the related table won't be automatically created;
  instead you must manually create it (e.g., with explicit SQLObject
  classes for the joins).

* Implemented ``RLIKE`` (regular expression LIKE).

* Moved _idSequence to sqlmeta.idSequence.

Small Features
--------------

* Select over RelatedJoin.

* SQLite foreign keys.

* Postgres DB URIs with a non-default path to unix socket.

* Allow the use of foreign keys in selects.

* Implemented addColumn() for SQLite.

* With PySQLite2 use encode()/decode() from PySQLite1 for BLOBCol if available; else use base64.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a longstanding problem with UnicodeCol - at last you can use unicode
  strings in .select() and .selectBy() queries. There are some limitations,
  though; see the description of the UnicodeCol_.

.. _UnicodeCol: SQLObject.html#column-types

* Cull patch (clear cache).

* .destroySelf() inside a transaction.

* Synchronize main connection cache during transaction commit.

* Ordering joins with NULLs.

* Fixed bugs with plain/non-plain setters.

* Lots of other bug fixes.

SQLObject 0.7.0
===============

Features & Interface
--------------------

* Inheritance. See Inheritance.html_

.. _Inheritance.html: Inheritance.html

* Date/time validators, converters, tests.

* Both `mxDateTime
  <http://www.egenix.com/files/python/mxDateTime.html>`_ and `datetime
  <http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-datetime.html>`_ supported
  for ``DateTimeCol``.

* Added ``BLOBCol``, for binary data.

* Added ``PickleCol``, to transparently pickle and unpickle data from
  column.

* New `documented reflection interface
  <http://svn.colorstudy.com/SQLObject/docs/interface.py>`_, using the
  new ``.sqlmeta`` class/instance.  Most special attributes that
  started with ``_`` were moved into ``sqlmeta`` (with leading
  underscore removed).

* New aggregate functions for select results, like
  ``cls.select().max(columnName)``: ``.max()``, ``.min()``,
  ``.avg()``.

* ``ConnectionHub`` aka ``sqlhub`` (@@: Needs documentation)

* Command-line client `sqlobject-admin
  <http://sqlobject.org/docs/sqlobject-admin.html>`_.

* ``StringCol`` has ``char_binary`` attribute, for explicit case
  handling in MySQL.

* Various joins now supported (LEFT, RIGHT, STRAIGHT, INNER, OUTER,
  CROSS): see `documentation
  <http://sqlobject.org/docs/SQLObject.html#left-join-and-other-joins>`_.
  Aliases for joining a table with itself.

* Subqueries/subselects (`see docs
  <http://sqlobject.org/docs/SQLObject.html#subqueries-subselects>`_).

* Select results support ``.filter(extra_query)``

* ``SQLMultipleJoin`` and ``SQLRelatedJoin``, like ``MultipleJoin``
  and ``RelatedJoin``, except return select results (@@: Document).

* `SingleJoin
  <http://sqlobject.org/docs/SQLObject.html#singlejoin-one-to-one>`_.

* Columns retain their order from the class definition to table
  creation.

* SQLObject now depends on the `FormEncode <http://formencode.org>`_
  library, and internal conversion/validation is done through
  FormEncode (was previously using old fork of FormEncode).

* Column instances can have attributes set on them (generally for
  annotating columns with extra data).

Other Changes
-------------

* When iterating over select results, a list is now immediately
  created with the full list of instances being selected.  Before
  instances were created on demand, as select results were 
  pulled out row-by-row.  The previous lazy behavior is available with
  the method ``lazyIter``, used like ``for obj in
  MyClass.select().lazyIter(): ...``.

* Test framework now uses `py.test
  <http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html>`_.

* SQLObject now uses a simpler metaclass
  (``sqlobject.declarative.DeclarativeMeta``).

* autoCommit and queryIns ?? (@@: expand)

* Deprecation (@@: document)

* Use `setuptools
  <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_ for packaging
  and installation.

Small Features
--------------

* ``IntValidator`` for testing ``IntCol`` inputs.

* Base style (``sqlobject.styles.Style``) is now a usable no-op style.

* SQLite in-memory databases allowed with ``sqlite:/:memory:``

* Keyword parameters allowed to ``connectionForURI`` (like
  ``debug=True``).

* More parameters passed to MySQL connections (unix_socket,
  named_pipe, init_command, read_default_file, read_default_group,
  connect_time, compress, named_pipe, use_unicode, client_flag,
  local_infile).

* ``DateTimeCol.now`` is a function for producing the current date,
  using whatever date/time module you are using (good for use as a
  default).

* Inherited classes fetched more efficiently (fewer queries).

* Decimal converter to create `decimal objects
  <http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-decimal.html>`_.

* Repository rearranged (now in
  ``http://svn.colorstudy.com/SQLObject/trunk``).

Bug Fixes
---------

* Tables with no columns can work.  Why would you have a table without
  a column?  We do not know, we try only to serve.

* Sybase ``_fromDatabase`` fixed.

* Various fixes to support most recent ``MySQLdb`` adapter, and
  ``pysqlite`` adapters.

* URI parsing improved, including Windows paths (for use with SQLite).

* ``selectBy(column=None)`` creates ``IS NULL`` query.

* ``selectBy(foreignKey=value)`` now supported (not just selecting by
  foreign key ID).

* ``cascade='null'`` wasn't working properly (was cascading all
  deletes, not nullifying!).

* Lots of other bug fixes.
