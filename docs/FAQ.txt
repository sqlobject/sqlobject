How can I do a LEFT JOIN?
-------------------------

The short: you can't.  You don't need to.  That's a relational way of
thinking, not an object way of thinking.  But it's okay!  It's not
hard to do the same thing, even if it's not with the same query.

For these examples, imagine you have a bunch of customers, with
contacts.  Not all customers have a contact, some have several.  The
left join would look like::

    SELECT customer.id, customer.first_name, customer.last_name, 
           contact.id, contact.address
    FROM customer
    LEFT JOIN contact ON contact.customer_id = customer.id

Simple
~~~~~~

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/leftjoin-simple.html

The effect is the same as the left join -- you get all the customers,
and you get all their contacts.  The problem, however, is that you
will be executing more queries -- a query for each customer to fetch
the contacts -- where with the left join you'd only do one query.  The
actual amount of information returned from the database will be the
same.  There's a good chance that this won't be significantly slower.
I'd advise doing it this way unless you hit an actual performance
problem.

Efficient
~~~~~~~~~

Lets say you really don't want to do all those queries.  Okay, fine:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/leftjoin-more.html

This way there will only be at most two queries.  It's a little more
crude, but this is an optimization, and optimizations often look less
than pretty.

But, say you don't want to get everyone, just some group of people
(presumably a large enough group that you still need this
optimization):

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/leftjoin-more-query.html

How Does Inheritance Work?
--------------------------

SQLObject is not intended to represent every Python inheritance
structure in an RDBMS -- rather it is intended to represent RDBMS
structures as Python objects.  So lots of things you can do in Python
you can't do with SQLObject classes.  However, some form of
inheritance is possible.

One way of using this is to create local conventions.  Perhaps:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/site-sqlobject.html

Since SQLObject doesn't have a firm introspection mechanism (at least
not yet) the example shows the beginnings of a bit of ad hoc
introspection (in this case exposing the ``_columns`` attribute in a
more pleasing/public interface).

However, this doesn't relate to *database* inheritance at all, since
we didn't define any columns.  What if we do?

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/inheritance.html

Unfortunately, the resultant schema probably doesn't look like what
you might have wanted:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/inheritance-schema.html

All the columns from ``person`` are just repeated in the ``employee``
table.  What's more, an ID for a Person is distinct from an ID for an
employee, so for instance you must choose ``ForeignKey("Person")`` or
``ForeignKey("Employee")``, you can't have a foreign key that
sometimes refers to one, and sometimes refers to the other.

Altogether, not very useful.  You probably want a ``person`` table,
and then an ``employee`` table with a one-to-one relation between the
two.  Of course, you can have that, just create the appropriate
classes/tables -- but it will appear as two distinct classes, and
you'd have to do something like ``Person(1).employee.position``.  Of
course, you can always create the necessary shortcuts, like:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/inheritance-faked.html

It's not the most elegant setup, but it's functional and flexible.
There are no plans for further support for inheritance (especially
since the composition of multiple classes is usually a better solution
anyway).


Composite/Compound Attributes
-----------------------------

A composite attribute is an attribute formed from two columns.  For
example:  

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/composite-schema.html

Now, you'll probably want to deal with one amount/currency value,
instead of two columns.  SQLObject doesn't directly support this, but
it's easy (and encouraged) to do it on your own:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/composite.html

You'll note we go to some trouble to make sure that ``Price`` is an
immutable object.  This is important, because if ``Price`` wasn't and
someone changed an attribute, the containing ``InvoiceItem`` instance
wouldn't detect the change and update the database.  (Also, since
``Price`` doesn't subclass ``SQLObject``, we have to be explicit about
creating properties)  Some people refer to this sort of class as a
*Value Object*, that can be used similar to how an integer or string
is used.

You could also use a mutable composite class:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/composite-mutable.html

Pretty much a proxy, really, but ``SOCoords`` could contain other
logic, could interact with non-SQLObject-based latitude/longitude
values, or could be used among several objects that have
latitude/longitude columns.


Non-Integer IDs
---------------

Yes, you can use non-integer IDs, but only in CVS_ now.

.. _CVS: http://sqlobject.org/#anonymous-cvs

If you use non-integer IDs, you will not be able to use automatic
``CREATE TABLE`` generation (i.e., ``createTable``).  You also will
have to give your own ID values when creating an object, like::

    color = Something.new(id="blue", r=0, b=100, g=0)

IDs are, and always will in future versions, be considered immutable.
Right now that is not enforced; you can assign to the ``id``
attribute.  But if you do you'll just mess everything up.  This will
probably be taken away sometime to avoid possibly confusing bugs
(actually, assigning to ``id`` is almost certain to cause confusing
bugs).

If you are concerned about enforcing the type of IDs (which can be a
problem even with integer IDs) you may want to do this::

    def Color(SQLObject):
        def _init(self, id, connection=None):
            id = str(id)
            SQLObject._init(self, id, connection)

Instead of ``str()`` you may use ``int()`` or whatever else you want.
This will be resolved in a future version when ID column types can be
declared like other columns.


Binary Values
-------------

Binary values can be difficult to store in databases, as SQL doesn't
have a widely-implemented way to express binaries as literals, and
there's differing support in database.

A possible way to keep this data in a database is by using encoding.
Base 64 is a good encoding, reasonably compact but also safe.  As
an example, imagine you want to store images in the database:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/image-binary.html

SQLite does not respect backslash quoting, so for instance ``\n`` is
not interpreted as a newline.  For the moment there's no resolution,
and this will mess up your base64-encoded values.  As a workaround:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/image-binary-sqlite.html
