TODO
----

* ``_fromDatabase`` currently doesn't support IDs that don't fit into
  the normal naming scheme.  It should do so.  You can still use
  ``_idName`` with ``_fromDatabase``.

* More databases supported.  There has been interest and some work in
  the progress for Oracle and Sybase support.

* Better transaction support -- right now you can use transactions
  for the database, but the object isn't transaction-aware, so
  non-database persistence won't be able to be rolled back.

* Optimistic locking and other techniques to handle concurrency.

* Profile of SQLObject performance, so that I can identify bottlenecks.

* Increase hooks with FormEncode (unreleased) validation and form
  generation package, so SQLObject classes (read: schemas) can be
  published for editing more directly and easily.  (First step: get
  Schema-generating method into sqlmeta class)

* Simple method (in sqlmeta) for serializing a SQLObject instance to a
  dictionary -- both a dead dictionary (copy of values) and a live
  dictionary (setting keys changes the instance).

* Automatic joins in select queries.

* More kinds of joins, and more powerful join results (closer to how
  `select` works).

* Refactor ``DBConnection`` to use parameterized queries instead of
  generating query strings.

* Deprecate support for Python 2.2. Start using logging instead of print
  for debugging output.

* Event system. This will effect columns; patterns like ``onUpdate``
  methods and whatnot.  Probably will use PyDispatcher:
  http://pydispatcher.sourceforge.net/
