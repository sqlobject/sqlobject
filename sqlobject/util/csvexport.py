    Export the SQLObject class ``soClass`` to a CSV file.

    ``soClass`` can also be a SelectResult object, as returned by
    ``.select()``.  If it is a class, all objects will be retrieved,
    ordered by ``orderBy`` if given, or the ``.csvOrderBy`` attribute
    if present (but csvOrderBy will only be applied when no select
    result is given).

    You can also pass in select results (or simply a list of
    instances) in ``select`` -- if you have a list of objects (not a
    SelectResult instance, as produced by ``.select()``) then you must
    pass it in with ``select`` and pass the class in as the first
    argument.

    ``writer`` is a ``csv.writer()`` object, or a file-like object.
    If not given, the string of the file will be returned.

    Uses ``connection`` as the data source, if given, otherwise the
    default connection.

    Columns can be annotated with ``.csvTitle`` attributes, which will
    form the attributes of the columns, or 'title' (secondarily), or
    if nothing then the column attribute name.

    If a column has a ``.noCSV`` attribute which is true, then the
    column will be suppressed.

    Additionally a class can have an ``.extraCSVColumns`` attribute,
    which should be a list of strings/tuples.  If a tuple, it should
    be like ``(attribute, title)``, otherwise it is the attribute,
    which will also be the title.  These will be appended to the end
    of the CSV file; the attribute will be retrieved from instances.

    Also a ``.csvColumnOrder`` attribute can be on the class, which is
    the string names of attributes in the order they should be
    presented.
