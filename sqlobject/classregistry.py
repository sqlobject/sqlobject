Resolves strings to classes, and runs callbacks when referenced
classes are created.

Classes are referred to only by name, not by module.  So that
identically-named classes can coexist, classes are put into individual
registries, which are keyed on strings (names).  These registries are
created on demand.

Use like::

    >>> from . import classregistry
    >>> registry = classregistry.registry('MyModules')
    >>> def afterMyClassExists(cls):
    ...    print('Class finally exists: %s' % cls)
    >>> registry.addClassCallback('MyClass', afterMyClassExists)
    >>> class MyClass:
    ...    pass
    >>> registry.addClass(MyClass)
    Class finally exists: MyClass

class ClassRegistry(object):
    """
    We'll be dealing with classes that reference each other, so
    class C1 may reference C2 (in a join), while C2 references
    C1 right back.  Since classes are created in an order, there
    will be a point when C1 exists but C2 doesn't.  So we deal
    with classes by name, and after each class is created we
    try to fix up any references by replacing the names with
    actual classes.

    Here we keep a dictionaries of class names to classes -- note
    that the classes might be spread among different modules, so
    since we pile them together names need to be globally unique,
    to just module unique.
    Like needSet below, the container dictionary is keyed by the
    class registry.
